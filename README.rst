CoreCommerce tools

gen-price-list:

    Generates a price list from CoreCommerce data in PDF form.  Prices
    are adjusted to include sales tax and are rounded to even dollar
    amounts.  The intent is to use the price list at fairs and shows
    to avoid the handling of change.  It also makes accounting easier
    because you can deal with round numbers.
